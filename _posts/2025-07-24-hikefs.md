# Introduction

I was digging into Hikvision DVR firmwares when I came across a binary called `hikefs`.
It is quite small (5344 bytes).

The name was intriguing so I decided to drop it in Ghidra.

I checked its behavior with qemu before reversing it to see if I could get any more hint on what it does.

```bash
user@workstation: -hikvision- $ qemu-arm-static -L ./rootfs/ ./rootfs/hikefs

Usage: hikefs [option] file file

    -k         CRYPT key
    -h         help
```

Based on the positional arguments and `-k` parameter it sounds like it takes a file as input, decrypt it and write it to the second specified file. 


# Reversing HikeFS

The binary only has one really interesting function, `main()`, it does everything.

![First](/assets/images/hikefs/1.png)

We can confirm on line 24 what we saw before. It takes two parameters, `k` which is mandatory (since the colon right after it) and an optional parameter, `h`. 

On line 26 we check if the parameter is equal to `0x6b` which is the hex representation of 'k', meaning it again check if the `k` parameter is passed, otherwise the help message is written to STDERR and it jumps to `LAB_000106c0`.

If it passed it uses `sscanf` to copy it to `&local_6c`. We know the key should be an integer thank to the format used.

![Second](/assets/images/hikefs/2.png)

The syntax on line 33 can be a bit confusing but it basically checks if argc is superior to 5. If it isn't it write the help message to STDERR and the function returns.

If it is superior to 5 then `local_74` is set to `argv[1]` which is the first file (input file) argument and `local_70` is set to `argv[2]` which is the second file argument (output file). 

The `access()` function is then used on `local_74` with the flag `0` (corresponds to `F_OK`), basically it checks if input file exists. If it does not exists it jumps back to `LAB_0001091c` which again write the help message to STDERR and returns.

![Third](/assets/images/hikefs/3.png)

On line 44 `iVar1` is then set to the value of `local_6c`, which we know from earlier is the key. It then checks if input or output files are NULL and returns if so.

Then on line 49 we can see `auStack_68`, defined on top of the function as a 68 bytes buffer. If both files are not empty it fills it with 64 bytes of zeros.  

On line 50 it uses the `open()` function on the input file with flag 0 (meaning `O_RDONLY`) and set its file descriptor to `__fd`. If the open failed it returns.

![Fourth](/assets/images/hikefs/4.png)

On like 55 it tries to read `0x40` (64) bytes from `__fd` which is the file descriptor of the input file and assign them to `auStack_68`.

If the read fails then it close the file descriptor and returns.

It then, on like 63 tries to compare the first two bytes of the `auStack_68` buffer to the 2 bytes located at memory address `&DAT_00021060` (`5d 00`) - basically it compares the first two bytes of the input file to `0x5d00`, this is some kind of magic bytes check.

If the first two bytes of `auStack_68` corresponds to two bytes located at the memory address then it sets `sVar2` to `0` and jumps to `LAB_000107cc` which in exits with the exit code `sVar2`, so, `0`.

If it does not correspond then it closes `__fd` (the file descriptor of the input file) and checks if `iVar1` (the key) is equal to `0`, if it is then it writes an error message and returns.

![Fifth](/assets/images/hikefs/5.png)

On line 73 it allocates `0x40` bytes (64 bytes) using `malloc()` and stores the pointer to `__s`. 

On line 74 another 64 bytes of memory is allocated and it stores the pointer to `__s_00`.

It then checks if the allocation failed, if so it prints an error message and jumps to `LAB_00010788`.

Then if it didn't fail, on line 81-82 it fills both 64 bytes regions in memory with zeros using the `memset()` function.

It then open the input file with flag `O_RDONLY` and set the file descriptor to `__fd_00`, right after it opens the output file with flags `0x42` and mode `0x1ff` and set the file descript to `__fd_01`.

The `0x42` flag correspond to `O_CREAT | O_RDWR` (`0x40 | 0x02`). The mode is only used if the file is being created, in such cases then it corresponds to mode `0777` (`0x1FF` is `511` in decimal and `0777` in octal).

![Sixth](/assets/images/hikefs/6.png)

On line 92, the `read()` function is used. It reads 64 bytes from `__fd_00`, the input file, copies the bytes to the `__s` buffer and set the number of bytes read to `sVar2`.

It should be noted that on line 108 we can see that this loop will repeat until 0 is superior than `sVar2`, meaning until the whole input file is read.

Between like 93-98, it checks whether some bytes were read or not.

All line 99 does is filling the rest of the `__s` buffer with zeros until all 64 bytes are set. This is only useful in case less than 64 bytes were read from the input file.

The loop between lines 102-106 is a simple XOR encryption/decryption loop. It XOR each bytes from the `__s` (the input file buffer basically) with the key specified by `-k` and stores the result in `__s_00`.

Once it finished looping over `__s` bytes it writes the result of the XOR operation to the output file.
